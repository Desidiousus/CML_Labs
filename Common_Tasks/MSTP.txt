	instance 2 vlan 12,13
	revision 1

Use the show spanning-tree mst configuration command to investigate the MST configuration on SW3.

Use the show spanning-tree mst configuration digest to confirm that the Digest hash is 
the same across all switches.

show spanning-tree mst 1
show spanning-tree mst 2

Once the root bridge has been determined, an MST nonroot device uses this sequence to choose the best path to the root bridge:
1.	Lowest root path cost
2.	Lowest sender BID
3.	Lowest sender Port_ID
