! Routing information protocol is most commonly deployed routing protocols, 
! most of the operating windows, Linux and novel system use RIP. 
! Routing information protocol is normally suitable for small office, 
! medium office, branch office environment and flat networks. 
! RIP is an interior routing protocol and used in inter-domain environment.  
! RIP have following three versions:
    ! 1. RIPv1 (version 1)
    ! 2. RIPv2 (version 2, VLMS and authentication support)
    ! 3. RIP NG (new generation, support IPV6)
! Features:
    ! RIP is distance vector routing protocol.
    ! Administrative distance for RIP is 120 that is most highest among other dynamic routing protocols. Administrative distance represents how much a route is trusted, routing protocols with higher administrative distance are less trust among others. Support if a router has multiple paths to same destination, then router will prefer route with lowest administrative distance.       
    ! Supports classless routing but RIPv2 also support VLSMâ€™s
    ! Subnet mask is included in route entry.
    ! RIP use the Hop count for metric or choosing best path, path will less hop to a destination will be preferred in RIP.
    ! RIP is suitable for small network and it support only 15 hop count and a route at 16 hops will be unreachable and inaccessible.
    ! RIP send its routing updates every 30 seconds to multicast address 224.0.0.9
    ! RIP supports authentication
    ! RIP carry 25 routes in its routing updates and if you use authentication then 24 routes per RIP message.
    ! RIP Uses UDP port 520.
    ! RIP provides different mechanism  for avoiding loops in networks, these methods are split horizon, poison reverse and
